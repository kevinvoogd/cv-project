# Computer Vision project.
##### Authors: Guru Deep Singh (xxxxxx) and  Kevin Luis Voogd (4682688)
In this repository we aim to develop a Computer Vision by Deep Learning project for the course CS4245 of TU Delft. In this repository, we use the findings of the paper *[PointRCNN: 3D Object Proposal Generation and Detection from Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04244.pdf "PointRCNN: 3D Object Proposal Generation and Detection from Point Cloud")*.
